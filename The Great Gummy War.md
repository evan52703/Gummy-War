# The Great Gummy War
By: Evan Trejo

### Introduction into the World of Gummies
Gummies have been at war alongside the beginning of **Christianity**. Long have fought to prove their side's superiority in this unending battle is won. Today I present the arguments from *both sides* in an effort to recruit new warriors in ending this clash of titans for generations to come.

### The Sides

#### Worms
Worms are already powerful in nature. Living in the ground and relatively hidden allows **exponential** reproduction due to safety, thus the worms are strong in numbers and even **multiply** if cut in half. For centuries, the bears have been studying the worms in lab to discover ways to eliminate them and found their weakness is *corrosive saliva*. the worms biggest weakness is their lack of limbs to escape the grasp of the bears. Their greatest strength binds gummy bears in a gummy-crushing cocoon.

**Supporters of Worms**
- *Gummy Arthropods*
- *Gummy Sea Creatures*
- *Gummy Invertebrates*
#### Bears
Bears are carnivorous beasts of nature. Once sink their gummy claws and feral fangs into their pray, their fight is already won. Their war against the worms spawned eons prior and rumors have it that they've experimented on the worms to dissect their strengths from weaknesses. The worms may outnumber the bears, but the intellect and brute strength has evened the battlefield.

**Supporters of Bears**
- *Gummy Mammals*
- *Gummy Quadrupeds*

### Haribo
An organization deemed ‘Haribo’ created synthetic creatures derived from sugar and fructose. Their experiments gave these beings life and from the beginning, they were sworn enemies.

Gummies began thirsting for more enhancements and thus power. They scaled equally over decades with their wars only becoming bigger and more brutal. Harbio has only encouraged and preserved this war from ending. With their constant gummy production and diversity, the war seemingly has no end in sight.

#### Haribo's Production Power
Haribo's production can be simplified to an equation completed in python code.

``` python
print ("Hello. Here we will estimate Haribo's production power")
print ("Input the year you wish to learn more about and we will list the gummies/hour (GPH)")



year = float(input("What is the year you wish to estimate Haribo's production power?"))
print(year)
 
print("Calculating...")
prod = (year-1920)**5

print("Haribo is producing ", prod," GPH during", year,"." )

input()
```


In these most recent years, Haribo's gummy production has scaled out of control and hope for a war-less tomorrow looks more and more unrealistic with each passing year.

### Looking Forward
Understanding the magnitude of production Haribo controls at this point is key in predicting our future. Gummies have garnered Haribo the necessary income to build their empire. Things have gotten so out of hand that the only solution to this war is stopping Harbio altogether. Soon, there will not be a future where stopping Haribo is possible. For whatever side you support, root for the destruction of this ungodly devilish thrashing beast of a "gummy company".
