### The Sides

#### Worms
Worms are already powerful in nature. Living in the ground and relatively hidden allows **exponential** reproduction due to safety, thus the worms are strong in numbers and even **multiply** if cut in half. For centuries, the bears have been studying the worms in lab to discover ways to eliminate them and found their weakness is *corrosive saliva*. the worms biggest weakness is their lack of limbs to escape the grasp of the bears. Their greatest strength binds gummy bears in a gummy-crushing cocoon.

#### Bears
Bears are carnivorous beasts of nature. Once sink their gummy claws and feral fangs into their pray, their fight is already won. Their war against the worms spawned eons prior and rumors have it that they've experimented on the worms to dissect their strengths from weaknesses. The worms may outnumber the bears, but the intellect and brute strength has evened the battlefield.
